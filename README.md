# Lit 2.0 7GUI Experiments

This project is an implementation of the 7GUI set of GUI programming benchmarks using Lit 2.0. (https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/)

The intent is to explore the use of the newly introduced reactive controllers in Lit 2.0 and sketch out ways to use them in a variety of contexts.
